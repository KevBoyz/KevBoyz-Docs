                <p>
                    First, to understand what I use, is important know who am I. My name is Kevin and I am a Python 
                    programmer and Front End developer. I like play games and make music beats. In this article I will 
                    show that I use, but you can just ignore if the thing don't does your profile.
                </p>
                <h2>The basics, any computer have something in this context</h2>
                <p class="p">
                    I use Windows10, but just few programs that I show don't be available in others systems.
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            Browser: <span class="em">Brave</span>. The most people uses Chrome, however it is much heavier than the others, 
                            in addition to mining bitconis, tracking information and selling to third parties. Brave is based on Chromium project and
                            have a default adblocker besides pay you to navigate.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Searcher: <span class="em">DuckDuckGo</span>. Ddg preserves your privacy in internet, different from google, 
                            that use your data to make money with others companies.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Terminal: <span class="em">Windows Terminal</span>. This terminal is customizable and most beautiful then
                            defalt terminal and have more features like initial folder set. You can download in Microsoft Store.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Ms_Dos: <span class="em">CMD or Command Prompt</span>. For me cmd is better then Powershell, because he is simple and fast.
                            Powershell have more features than cmd, but I never need than.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Zip-Extractor: <span class="em">Winrar</span>. I really prefer use Lash (my own software) to extract and compact zip, but
                            in many cases, this files are shared with .rar extencion, impossibilizing to extract. If you are interested in Lash, you can
                            istall with <span class="em">pip install lash</span> command, this is, if you have Python 3.5> installed.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Anti-virus: <span class="em">Windows Default</span>. I don't like antiviruses because they consume a lot of memory and procing.
                            I just opt for the Default antivirus to have a miniml protection, but if you is a inexperienced user I recomend you to install 
                            Pandas, is a free, simple and powerfull antivirus.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </p>
                <h2>Development programs</h2>
                <p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            Python IDE: <span class="em">Pycharm</span>. For me, this is the best editor for python. He have lot resources and
                            plugins, in addition to great themes. If you want something lighter, I recomend Atom-IDE.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Web-Development: <span class="em">Visual Studio Code</span>. Is the most used IDE to develop sites. 
                            VSCode is fast and simple. He have many plugins like IA to help you to codeo or previw to your site.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Version Contro System: <span class+="em">Git</span>. Git is the most popullar VSC and is the that I recommend. I use he with
                            Github, to develop and distribute open source programs.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Image Editor: <span class="em">Gimp</span>. Sometimes I need do a simple edition in some images, so I use Gimp. He's not so simple and
                            if you never see something like, you probably need do a basic curse. If you want edit images with better proficionalism, I recomend PhotoShop.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Music Production: <span class="em">FL Studio 20</span>. My hobbie is producting music and to do that I use Fl Studio. Is a very good workspace for
                            Dj's and the most used by then. With FlS you can make any type of music. This software is it's paid, but you can free download a trial ver. 
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <h2>Tools, the most cool programs in Desktop, in my opinion</h2>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            Toolkit: <span class="em">Lash</span>. I create lash minding about soluting my problems. Lash has 10+ functions to solve different problems like schedule tasks, spy a computer or
                            start new web project, anyway I recommend you test. Lash is a command line interface, to use it, you need to type short commands in terminal.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            To print screen: <span class="em">LigthShot</span>. Simple and powerfull, I use to take prints.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Steam emualator: <span class="em">SSELauncher</span>. Good for crack games. Using this, many games will run like originals. 
                            This is obvious, but SSEL just works for Steam games.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            To flood a chat: <span class="em">Flood.exe</span>. You never gonna found this if you search. I won this in a underground repository and like.
                            With this toll, you can...Flood a chat, I swear it's not malware, download here if you, want test this.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            To update drivers: <span class="em">Iobit Drive Booster</span>. Is a good software to update your drivers, but listen (or read), just update your drivers
                            if you realy need do this, else, don't update, this is not necessary and in some case you may have problems doing this updates.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            To download Windows Iso's: <span class="em">Windows ISO installer</span>. Sometimes, I think: Uhmmm...Why I don't destroy a Windows in virtual machine?
                            In this cases, I download the iso with this program, but you can do that just download free from Microsoft site. In WII the iso's are cracked and have a infinite licence.
                            Use if you want install Windows freerly in your machine. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Iso manipulation: <span class="em">PowerIso</span>. Look like Winrar, I use this software to mont iso like a cdrom to crack games, like BF3, MaxPayne3, Farcry3 and etc.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            To Cheat: <span class="em">Cheat Engine</span>. With this toll you can manipulate a program values from the computer memory. Good if you want change data's in you local machine, but
                            obviously, don't works on online games. I used CE to full life bar on Enter The Gungeon.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            To read a pdf file: <span class="em">Adoble Acrobat Reader</span>. This program is so famous and is problatable that you already use it.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </p>
