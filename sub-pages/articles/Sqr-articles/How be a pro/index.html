                    Technology becomes more and more important in our lives, failing to learn about means
                     waste the opportunity to use the most versatile creation ever made. I see how most people
                     does not have the basic knowledge to handle devices such as cell phones or computers and how to do that
                     makes their lives difficult. Learning about technology gave me the opportunity to get more out of it,
                     Naturally gaining experience, you will quickly be able to adapt to the level of constant changes that happen in the technological world.
                     Most professions these days somehow involve a computer or technological medium, you must
                     learn about or will be left behind by those who see it that way.

                        <h2>Gaining affinity</h2>
                        <p>
                            First of all, keep in mind that software is meant to be used, but why did I say that?
                            Current software models are meant to be understood only by their interfaces, which
                            are generally familiar to the user, thus making it easier for him to learn to use that feature almost
                            automatically, it's all a matter of starting up and seeing how everything in computing is similar.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Every day, computing becomes simpler, if you need to use a new program, you can
                            simply digest the information from its interface and draw a conclusion from there, about how to interact
                            with him. As in the case of this site, a title that when clicked returns to the main page and scrolled text to
                            on the left, it all seemed naturally familiar to anyone consuming it.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Gaining affinity means exploring a computer, discovering new things and using them for your benefit, over and over again.
                            time, learning something new and adapting becomes easier when studying technology. The world today is liquid and
                            we all must adapt to constant changes.

                        <h2>It's all a matter of practicing</h2>
                        <p>
                            What makes you evolve in technology is the constant exposure to the unknown, by doing this, you will easily know which decision
                            take in certain circumstances, at the beginning, it is likely that you will face problems that you cannot solve
                            alone, but this is normal and happens even in the lives of the most skilled IT professionals. if you don't have a direction
                            to follow where you can learn something involving technology, I recommend you if you find out, this process is quite complicated.
                            mainly because something like this usually comes to you, out of nowhere, at some point your call will happen, and it's up to
                            whether you grab it or let it go, later on this trexo will make more sense.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The first thing to do is study about what your operating system is capable of doing, there is certainly a lot that
                             you don't know, especially if you're a beginner, the first steps are quite complicated because you don't have a vision.
                            about technology, from the moment the user starts to understand what is happening around him, everything starts to make sense.
                            To understand something, you first need to know how to build it, with the skills I've reached, I see meaning in practically everything
                            that I have contact on a computer, I can see beyond the superficial, something that can only be developed with affinity and experience.

                            This article, like many others on this site, is not intended to teach the reader, but to help them evolve by seeking knowledge by
                            account itself, the learning method that I find most efficient, if you are looking for something, then it makes sense to you, unlike
                            most educational institutions, which determine what each student should and should not learn. With a comprehensive view, in any area,
                            you must seek knowledge on your own to become who you want to be.

                        <h2>Look for smart solutions to your problems</h2>
                        <p>
                            The world of technology is a sea of problems, over the years many of them were solved and today there is a solution for practically everything. IT'S
                             It's very rare to find a problem on the internet today that no one has ever tried to solve, and with so many solutions, it becomes easier and easier to take advantage of technology.
                             It's important to highlight that all kinds of evolution starts from a necessity, that's why I'm always looking for something new, the issue is that there are problems
                             very specific that because each case is a case, solving them would become extremely complex. From the moment you expand your
                             horizons, the complexity of your problems will increase, consider a problem every issue to be resolved, and not something harmful.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As I said, today there is already a solution for most problems, the problem that there are still unsolved problems is also a problem, which
                            in turn, it also has a solution. There are now software that perform programmatic automation in a simple way and can be configured by anyone,
                            it is no longer necessary to do anything from 0, there will always be a facilitation, you must acquire this knowledge to solve your own issues.

                            Programming is a very good way to meet the needs of a user with complex problems, in this case, to reach a significant result.
                            in the schedule, there are these months of study, but this varies according to the ability of each person to learn, it's all a matter of meeting your demands, you must decide
                            whether or not something is worth dedicating to. Even if you don't program, you can solve most of your problems with third-party software or proprietary features.

                        <h2>Learn about everything</h2>
                        <p>
                            Limiting yourself to a single content for a long time will create an imbalance in learning, an experienced user should know a little bit of everything, everything involving technology
                            it must be versatile, that doesn't mean that you should study a lot at the same time, it would only harm your learning, since in the end, you would know very little about
                            everything, study one thing at a time, and only stop when you get all the knowledge in this box.
                        </p>

                            The big problem when you don't understand the subject and you're going to study on your own is that you don't know what to study, it's hard for me to show you what you should
                            or not to study, it all depends on what you need to know, naturally your view on the subject will expand and you will know what to do. In the beginning, everything revolves around
                            from curiosity, this is how humanity has evolved to this day, exploring.

                        <p>
                            Before improving what you already know, try to get out of your comfort zone, so your brain will create new connections, you will see that differently
                            what you did before, when that happens you will have evolved.

                            Using only the preset creates limitations. I've always liked to customize whatever it is, it can even be simple, but it helps the user to know what it is.
                            that he uses. I use the Windows 10 operating system, so far what I've done is: change the cursor layout, use a terminal with wallpaper, make the theme dark,
                            change the position of the taskbar over the top of the screen and make it retractable, change the system sounds to those of the mouse program, create permanent startup variables,
                            modifying the saturation, brightness and contrast of the screen, as well as smoothing it out, a process that I highly recommend, as it damages vision while using a device.
                            are the blue rays emitted by the screen.

                    Well, from what I myself realized, this article was very repetitive, the key point for evolving in technology, it's not that different from evolving in anything else,
                    everything starts with interest or necessity. Getting everything that was passed on in this article is completely unfeasible, you must learn about what was written here alone,
                    and being a child of experience. There's a lot more to computing than most people can imagine. Remember, the discovery of America was a mistake that turned
                    in a great gift, so be it your study career.
