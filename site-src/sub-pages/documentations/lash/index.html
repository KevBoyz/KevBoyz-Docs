                <h2>How install and execute</h2>
                <p>
                    You need to have Python3.5 > and pip installed in your machine, 
                    you can installed on <a href="https://www.python.org/">python.org</a>,
                    after that, follow the steps below:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Open your terminal and type <span class="command">pip install lash</span></li>
                    <li>If the installation works, type: <span class="command">python -m lash</span></li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    * In <span class="em">Linux systems</span>, it's possible that this process will fail,
                    I really couldn't resolve the <span class="emb">error: beep.wav don't exists or not a regular file</span> , but in <span class="em">Windows</span>, still working.
                    If this error persists, download the desired version from the <a href="https://github.com/KevBoyz/Lash/releases">github repository</a> as zip or tar.gz and modify setup.py, removing the inclusion of the
                    beep.wav and web_package.zip files, after that run the command <span class="em">setup.py install</span>, everything should work normally, but the command <span class="em">web new</span> will be crashed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span class="em">Lash</span> usage syntax is: <span class="command">lash commands options args</span>, 
                    many commands heve sub-commands in the same content, in this case, you need type the main command and the sub, sequencialy.
                </p>
                <h2>Commands usage, use as reference if you need.</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <h3>autoclick</h3>
                        <p> <span class="emb">- Command not working, cause: Bug. Working on 1.0.0</span></p>
                        <p>
                            Perform autoclicker to fast cliking or continuos click. You can set the click
                            delay using the -cd (value in seconds) option be like: <span class="em">-cd 0.1</span> -> 10cps or if 
                            you want click and hold just use the <span class="em">-ch</span> option, if you don't use any option
                            the command will return a raise error. Finally use f4/f3  as shortcut keys to on/off. Note,
                            this feature don't works much better consider clicking f3 several times to stop.
                        </p>

                                    result can be viewd in percentage or floating number (more precise) with -d option. Example: 
                                    <span class="em">calc prob 10 1</span> -> 10% or 0.1 if -d.

                            <span class="em">keyhold w</span>, after enter command press f4 to start. This command has maked as 
                            complement for click and hold function, is the perfect combination to auto mine in Minecraf (game).
                        </p>

                            Organize files quickly. the basic command need the path at be organized, by default he's organized 
                            documents and 'others files'. You also have the option to organize sub-folders and midias with options
                            specified in --help section. It's possible organize specified file type with -ft option. Command usage example: 
                            <span class="em">lash organize -ft .pdf C:\Users\User\Downloads</span>.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3>random</h3>
                        <p>
                            Randomize decimal numbers, you can set in options: beginning and end of random set (1-5) and number
                            of output characters. <span class="em">random -s 0 -e 1 -c 10</span> -> 0100010010.

                    <li>
                        <h3>sched</h3>
                        <p>
                            My favorite command at lash, with this you can schedule tasks in your computer.
                            Sched have 3 sub-commands but all have the same purpose, after a time intervall, 
                            one command will be executed on terminal.
                        </p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                <h4>run</h4>
                                <p>
                                    Run commands repetitively at a given interval starting from current machine time.
                                    Interesting to perform the same task every 5 minutes or seconds, like
                                    for example an update. <span class="em">sched run</span> must receive the command
                                    to be executed in quotes after the declaration of the waiting time (h/m/s). Example:
                                    <span class="em">run "help" 0 0 2</span>.
                                </p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <h4>wait</h4>
                                <p>
                                    Wait x time, run a task once and exit. Ideal for carrying out a waiting task,
                                    how to run an alarm or anything else, its usage mode is the same as
                                    <span class="em">run</span>, however it has an extra feature, the remaining time
                                    is written in the terminal that is relative to the remaining hours, minutes and seconds.
                                </p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <h4>exec</h4>
                                <p>
                                    Execute a task from determined moment of day. If you need be more specific,
                                    this command will help you. Like the other sched subcommands, exec uses the 
                                    machine's own time. To use you need set the time like a clock display: hh:mm:ss. 
                                    Example: <span class="em">exec 10:30:0 "help"</span>
                                </p>
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3>spy</h3>
                        <p>
                            Gray Hat Tool Kit, use for espionage, theft or protection.
                        </p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                <h4>keylogger</h4>
                                <p>
                                    Save all keyboard actions in .txt file, for use declare the exit location of the
                                    final file, if not declared, will be sent to the current folder of the
                                    terminal. Once active, it can be disabled by pressing <span class="em">f3</span>
                                </p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <h4>crypt</h4>
                                <p>
                                    Encrypt files with the AES algorithm, be careful when using, you will need a 
                                    16-character key to encrypt and decrypt the file (-dc option to decrypt).
                                    Example: <span class="em">crypt text.txt $ycjms1@7y602qkx</span>.
                                </p>
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Taskkiller</h4>
                        <p>
                           This command is interesting if you want to boost your machine, with it you can kill
                           multiple processes just by running  <span class="em">lash taskkiller</span>. Note <span class="emb">permission errors</span> can occur
                           while programs are closed. To use this command you must first blacklist the processes
                           so they can all be killed at once. It is necessary to go to the package's installation
                           folder, which in my case is:  <span class="em">C:\Users\User\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python39\Lib\site-packages\lash</span>
                           and then go through the following path: <span class="em">lash/Exportables</span>
                           and open the <span class="em">config.py</span>  file. Once this is done, the names must be put in the <span class="em">black_list</span>
                           variable, surrounded by quotation marks and separated by a comma.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3>web</h3>
                        <p>Toolkit for web, I don't have ideas for subcommands, but the one that I make is really userfull</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                <h4>new</h4>
                                <p>
                                    Start new web project, this command creates html, css and js files to quickly start your site.
                                    The usage is simple, declare the path to extract the files.
                                </p>
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3>zip</h3>
                        <p>Zip tools, one of the first commands I did</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                <h4>compress</h4>
                                <p>
                                    Compress files into zip file. Declare the folder to be zipped, this command is the coolest 
                                    that you can find in this package.
                                </p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <h4>extract</h4>
                                <p>
                                    Extract a zip file, simple as that, I don't think I need to tell you what you should 
                                    do to use this command, but if in doubt use --help.
                                </p>
                            </li>
